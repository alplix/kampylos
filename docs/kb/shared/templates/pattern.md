## The defect

What goes wrong and what a volunteer sees. Written for someone who does not know the repository it was found in.

## Why it happens

The mechanism, with the facts it rests on (link shared/boinc-api.md where it is a BOINC API fact).

## How to check a repository

Concrete steps another repository can run: the grep commands, what a hit must look like to count as `affected`,
what makes it `not-affected`, and what makes it `n/a`. Record the result with that repository's `kb.py ledger`.

## How to fix

The fix in general terms, and the reference fix if there is one.

## How to test

A test or a manual reproduction that fails before the fix and passes after it.
